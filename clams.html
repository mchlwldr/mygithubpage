<h2>Clams</h2>
<p>The clam is an incredible species. First evolving over 500 million years ago, the clam has proven to be a hardy organism. It has managed to outlive an untold number of species, including the dinosaurs. Now they are found across the globe and in a wide range of shapes in sizes. Some clams are even eaten. Clams are an important part of underwater ecosystems, so it makes sense to learn a bit about this ancient survivor</p>

<h3><a id="S1">Clam Basics</a></h3>
<p>Clams are actually called bivalve molluscs, but we like using their nickname because the clam is our buddy. Clams can be found in all sorts of places, in either fresh or salt water. They can also range from microscopically tiny to the size of a small car. Clams are crazy little critters.</p>
<h4>The Bivalve Mollusc</h4>
<p>The term Bivalve Mollusc relates a lot about what a clam actually is. Molluscs refer to a wife range of invertebrate animals, including most shelled creatures, slugs, octopods (like the octopus), and many other organisms. Bivavle Molluscs are named so because they are composed of two hinged shells, and other bivalves include oysters, mussles, and scallops.</p>
<p>Clams are pretty simple creatures. The don't have heads, but most can react to changes in light, and few have simple eyes. They do have most other organ systems we are familiar with as humans, such as a nervous system, a digestive tract, and a heart. Some have syphons that they use to capture food. </p>
<h4>From the Ocean and beyond</h4>
<p>Clams can be found all over the globe, in both fresh and salt water. </p>

<h3><a id="S2">Clam Eating</a></h3>
<p>Clams are eaten in many different cultures, and in many different ways. Seafood is an essential part of diets worldwide, so it is no suprise that clams are a source of food. Clam dishes vary from region to region, through both local customs and through the local clam species. Some places have even eaten certain local clam species to the verge of extinction.</p>
